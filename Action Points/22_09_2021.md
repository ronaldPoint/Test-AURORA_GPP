Details regarding GPP - Obstacle clearance dynamic scaling:

 

- Formula for calculating the obstacle horizontal and vertical clearance shall be defined that relates at least the following parameters:

- Aircraft 3D position in local coordinate frame 
- Obstacle 3D position in local coordinate frame
- Aircraft speed over ground (m/sec) in local coordinate frame 
- Aircraft acceleration (m/sec/sec) in lateral (x-y) plane in local coordinate frame 
- Aircraft acceleration (m/sec/sec) in vertical (x-z) plane in local coordinate frame 
- Aircraft height above ground level (m) in local coordinate frame 
- Aircraft’s maximum rate of change (deg/sec) in lateral (x-y) plane of the navigation coordinate frame 
- Aircraft’s maximum rate of change (deg/sec) in vertical (x-z) plane of the navigation coordinate frame 
- Wind direction (deg; wrt true North) and speed (m/s) in navigation coordinate frame 
- Local coordinate frame is defined as tangential 3D Cartesian frame whose origin is fixed at the obstacle, with x-axis pointed to geographic North, y-axis is pointed to East, and z-axis being perpendicular to the x-y plane and pointing upwards.

 

Aircraft navigation coordinate frame is defined as 3D Cartesian frame whose origin is fixed at the aircraft’s center of mass, with x-axis pointing towards aircraft’s nose, y-axis pointing towards aircraft’s right wing tip, while z-axis pointing downwards.

 

Obstacle clearance in horizontal and vertical plane shall have values in (m).
