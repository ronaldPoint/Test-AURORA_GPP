**ACTION POINTS 17/06/2021**

**Ronald:**

- [x] Conference paper preparation 
- [x] Parameters exploration for probabilistic algorithms
- [x] Real-life scenarios to share with the team + horizontal distance adjustment for obstacles

**Payam:**

- [ ] MATLAB - evaluation for real life scenarios (with Ronald's full geo data at different heights slices)
- [ ] Explore tools feasibility (QGIS/Postgres, ArcGIS, Python) - no need to develop scenarios in all of them (if not necessary), just to evaluate if they are viable option, if MATLAB is not (or also possible an complementary option)

**Nacho**

- [ ] 2D path post processing - arc computation 

**Silvio**

- [ ] Provide airspace constraints specimen
- [ ] Provide noise sensitive areas specimen
