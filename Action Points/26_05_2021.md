**ACTION POINTS 26/05/2021**

**Ronald:**

- [ ] Define PC agnostic metric for algorithms comparison and follow-up of the future upgrades of the known algorithms.
- [ ] Evaluate algorithms based on the joint metrics (also on new scenarios that will be provided by Payam).

**Payam:**

- [ ] Add the description of 4th the scenario in the Google drive document.
- [ ] Explore shapes for defining airspace constraints & define new 2D scenarios based on these (in the Google doc file and if possible, just share the scenario files in GitHub)
- [ ] Develop notation for scenarios (so that in future we can simply just refer to the notation, without needing to describe the scenario for internal communication)

**Nacho**

- [ ] Try to apply the graph of actions-based approach for the defined scenarios
- [ ] See if on the defined scenarios we can have as a result the reduced search space and sequence of nodes to visit as an output (2D and static environment)
- [ ] See if an alternative approach to define zones (that takes into consideration the shape of the obstacle) would be efficient

**Silvio**

- [ ] Provide airspace constraints specimen
- [ ] Provide noise sensitive areas specimen
