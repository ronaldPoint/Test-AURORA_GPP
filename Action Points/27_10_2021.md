**Please find below our action point from today's meeting.**

 [@Payam Khazaelpour](mailto:Payam.Khazaelpour@UGent.be)

- [ ] \- consult the initial GGP document for nomenclature alligment

- [ ] \- remove dynamic clearance from the cost function

- [ ] \- adjust wind calculation to work with the defined input (wind speed and direction), integrate transformation if needed into the cost function

- [ ] \- integrate temperature into the cost function

- [ ] \- shape simulation for the inputs (wind speed and direction, temperature) and outputs 'estimated endurance' and 'remaining endurance'

 

[@Ronald Alberto Ponguillo Intriago](mailto:RonaldAlberto.PonguilloIntriago@UGent.be)

- [x] \- look for examples of search space inputs

- [ ] \- integrate airspace constraints

- [x] \- schedule a call with SEAL on Friday if needed to discuss details

 

[@Ignacio Querol Puchal](mailto:ignacioquerolpuchal@sealaero.com)

- [ ] \- provide a code sample for Ronald if needed (so that search space definition software can be provided in the correct format to feed A* and visibility graph solver)

- [ ] \- integrate 3th dimension into GPP path solver

- [ ] \- flight envelope constrains formulation

 

[@Silvio Semanjski](mailto:silvio.semanjski@sealaero.com)

- [ ] \- support Payam if needed by pointing out where to look for the temperature and endurance modeling

- [x] \- share airspace constraints example with Ronald

- [ ] \- support Ignacio with flight envelope introduction

 

Additional small note:

- [x] The Siemens workshops are planned for the beginning of November (most likely the 8th of November, so please keep the date available in your agenda)

 

With kind regards,

Ivana
