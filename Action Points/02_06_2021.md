**ACTION POINTS 02/06/2021**

**Ronald:**

- [x] Define PC agnostic metric for algorithms comparison
- [ ] Define scenarios (different obstacles characteristics) and compare algorithms based on the metric
- [ ] Draw conclusions regarding the potential for know algorithms to be a basis for our future GPP upgrades

**Payam:**

- [ ] Add the description of 4th the scenario in the Google drive document.
- [ ] Explore different shapes for defining airspace constraints (based on Silvio's example) & define new 2D scenarios based on these (in the Google doc file and if possible, just share the scenario files in GitHub)
- [ ] Test algorithms on 2D plane of real system data (data shared by Silvio, at z coordinate=30m)
- [ ] Develop notation for scenarios (so that in the future we can simply just refer to the notation, without needing to describe the scenario for internal communication)

**Nacho**

- [ ] See if on the defined strategies to reduced search space and sequence of nodes to visit as an output (2D and static environment) 
- [ ] Test the above on the real system data shared by Silvio, 2D plane at z coordinate=30m
- [ ] See if an alternative approach to define zones (that takes into consideration the shape of the obstacle) would be efficient

**Silvio**

- [ ]  Provide airspace constraints specimen
- [ ] Provide noise sensitive areas specimen
