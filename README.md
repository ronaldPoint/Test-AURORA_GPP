# Test-AURORA_GPP
This repository was created to share the documentation about the evaluation of Global Path Planning Algorithms of the **AURORA** project.



## **Some remarks about the code**

## How to use (From the original GitHub)

1. Clone this repo.

> git clone https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics.git

1. Install the required libraries.

using conda :

> conda env create -f environment.yml

using pip :

> pip install -r requirements.txt

1. Execute python script in each directory.

2. Add star to this repo if you like it ðŸ˜ƒ.

   

### **After Installation**

This code in this repository is a modified version from **Python Robotics** library, with a bunch of path planning algorithms in 2 dimensions. After the installation of requirements above mentioned, you should to do the next steps: 

1. The code can easily run opening the folder code and copy the **PathPlanning** sub folder in any directory you want on your computer.
2. Copy the file **RobotPP.py** in the lib folder inside your python installation folder, if you are working on Windows
3. If you are working in Linux, search for you Python installation and copy de file **RobotPP.py** in subfolder **/lib/pythonXX/**, where XX is the number of your python version
4. Run, test and enjoy the examples



### Additional Note

The file **dataTests.xlsx** contain a data set of the algorithms evaluation with each maps presented. The comparison was done in Length obtained and time required for each case.
